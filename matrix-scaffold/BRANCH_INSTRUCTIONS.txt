Branch & PR instructions

1) Create a feature branch from the current branch (recommended name):

   git checkout -b feature/matrix-dashboard

2) Commit the scaffold changes (already staged in workspace) and push:

   git add matrix-scaffold
   git commit -m "feat(matrix): add dashboard MVP scaffold (simulated runner)"
   git push origin feature/matrix-dashboard

3) Open a PR using the contents of `matrix-scaffold/PR_TEMPLATE.md` and attach a short GIF demonstrating the flow.

4) Reviewers should follow `matrix-scaffold/ACCEPTANCE.md` to verify Milestone 1.

If you prefer I prepare the branch and open the PR for you, grant push access or push the branch I prepare locally.
